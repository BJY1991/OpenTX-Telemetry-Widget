### General Information

* Flashing values indicate a warning (for example: no telemetry, battery low, altitude too high)
* Beeping/vibration is associated with critical warnings and there will be an associated flashing value to indicate what the beep/vibration is a result of
* The script gives voice feedback for flight modes, battery levels and warnings (no need to manually set this up)

* To flip between compass-based direction and launch/pilot-based orientation and location, use the dial or +/- buttons
* The launch/pilot-based orientation view is useful if model orientation is unknown
* If model is further than 25 feet away, the launch/pilot-based view will show the direction of the model based on launch/pilot position and orientation (useful to locate a lost model)
