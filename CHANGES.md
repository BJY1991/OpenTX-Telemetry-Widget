# Release History

## v1.3.2 - 06/20/2018

* Transmitter voltage options specific to transmitter's display size and if Rx voltage is displayed
* Allow speed sensor selection between GPS speed or pitot sensor's air speed (if available)
* Disable (and set to default) setting if sensor isn't present
* Disabled settings are now skipped over instead of allowing selection
* Removed `getLastPos()` function dependency which cleans up code, should be faster, and allows future Horus support

## v1.3.1 - 05/29/2018

* Support added for the X-Lite transmitter (requires OpenTX v2.2.2)
* Option to set the low and critical warning level for fuel percentage remaining
* Option to display the transmitter voltage as a graph and/or the numerical value
* Modified how battery cell count is calculated
* Can now set cell critical voltage to as low as 2.6v to support 18650 batteries
* Slightly adjusted display positioning to show greater GPS accuracy on QX7 and X-Lite transmitters

## v1.3.0 - 05/13/2018

* Compatibility with new F.Port protocol (requires INAV v1.9.1+)
* Support added for D-series receivers with telemetry (requires INAV v2.0+)
* Option to show GPS coordinates as degrees and minutes or in geocoding format instead of the previous decimal only
* Shows `THR WARN` if not okay to fly and throttle isn't at minimum position
* If distance sensor name is the default `0420`, the max distance now displays correctly
* Updated data digits to display before truncating unit of measure

## v1.2.5 - 04/28/2018

* Uses GPS for launch-based altitude if barometer isn't present
* No longer requires `0420` sensor to be renamedÂ `Dist`
* Better error handling, specially if `iNav` folder doesn't exist
* Renamed PASSTHRU mode MANUAL and add audio file for manual mode
* Correct altitude unit designation in configuration when barometer isn't present
* Adjustment to data display for min/max indicator

## v1.2.4 - 04/17/2018

* Satellite and altitude hold are now icons
* Added flashing notification for headfree mode on QX7 (already existed on X9D)
* Smarter unit designation resulting in a cleaner display (ft = ', MPH & km/h)

## v1.2.3 - 12/19/2017

* Logs the last 5 unique GPS coordinates
* Updated readme screenshots to show variometer
* Release history is now here instead of in readme file

## v1.2.2 - 12/09/2017

* Last 5 GPS coordinates can be reviewed from the config menu
* Resolved issue where if telemetry was lost/recovered it would incorrectly give voice alerts for flight modes/engines armed/disarmed
* Config menu can be accessed at any time, even when armed

## v1.2.1 - 12/01/2017

* Lots of new/changed config settings (press `Menu` button to access) - **Please review!**
* Enhanced and cleaned up config menu, centered menu on QX7 & X9D/+
* Variometer shows if model is gaining or decreasing altitude
* Cell voltage battery view shows with two digits of precision
* Added `S` (South) to X9D/+ directional display

## v1.2.0 - 11/18/2017

* Lua Telemetry is now pre-compiled to greatly reduce memory (source still available)
* Press `Menu` button (when not armed) to modify user configuration options
* Fixed `FAILSAFE`, `RTH`, `NOT OK` & `NO TELEM` modes to flash as they should
* Barometer and magnetometer are now optional (but suggested for full functionality)
* Headfree indication on QX7 changed to show directional indicators as dotted lines
* Startup message/version and error if not running OpenTX v2.2.0 or later

## v1.1.7 - 11/02/2017

* Fix for the default unit type of the `Dist` (`0420`) sensor

## v1.1.6 - 11/01/2017

* On home reset, reset GPS home position, orientation and distance
* Option to display average battery cell voltage instead of total voltage
* Extra digit for data on X9D & X9D+ transmitters
* Variable cleanup saving memory

## v1.1.5 - 10/20/2017

* Voice notification for `Home Reset` with INAV v1.8+
* Moved head free warning on QX7 to top center
* Values convert from decimal to integer when larger to allow for more room
* Better text centering and right justification technique
* Cleaned up code saving more memory

## v1.1.4 - 10/13/2017

* More accurate max altitude alerts and altitude flashes when above max altitude
* Long-press <Enter> resets values (suggest doing this between flights before armed)

## v1.1.3 - 10/10/2017

* Shows metric or imperial values based on transmitter telemetry settings

## v1.1.2 - 10/06/2017

* Lots of refactoring which greatly reduced memory usage
* Re-enabled altitude bar gauge for X9D, X9D+ & X9E transmitters
* Better information layout if no current sensor is present
* Refactored GPS lock calculation to prevent script syntax errors

## v1.1.1 - 09/28/2017

* Refactored code to reduce memory
* Removed altitude bar gauge for X9D, X9D+ & X9E transmitters (used too much memory?)

## v1.1.0 - 09/22/2017

* Repository moved to INAVFlight
* Screen formatting for Taranis X9D, X9D+ & X9E

## v1.0.0 - 09/19/2017

* Initial release
